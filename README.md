## Features

### 🎨 Color Customization

- **Light/Dark Theme**: Switch between light and dark themes for a comfortable sketching experience.
- **Color Palette**: Choose colors using hex codes or RGBA values for precise color control.

### 📐 Dynamic Canvas

- **Dynamic Grid**: Adjust the grid size to create detailed or larger pixel art.
- **Toggle Borders**: Show or hide grid borders for a clean or structured look.

### ✏️ Drawing Modes

- **Brush Mode**: Draw with the selected color from the palette.
- **Rainbow Mode**: Paint with random colors for a fun, vibrant effect.
- **GrayScale Mode**: Converts the current color to grayscale, starting at 10% saturation and increasing by 10% with each stroke until reaching 100% (black).
- **Eraser Mode**: Erase any colored pixel and revert it to the background color.

### 🛠️ Additional Features

- **Clear Grid**: Instantly clear the canvas to start a new drawing.
- **One Active Mode at a Time**: Only one mode button stays active, preventing mode conflicts and enhancing usability.
- **Import Image**: Upload an image to convert it into pixel art on the grid. The image will be resized to fit the grid, and each pixel will correspond to a cell on the canvas.
- **Export as Image**: Save your pixel art as a PNG image. If no color is drawn, the background will be white, ensuring a clean canvas for exporting.
